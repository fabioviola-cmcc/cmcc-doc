\section{Refactoring\dots}

I made a small re-organisation of Svitlana's code, in order to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item put the software under versioning and be able to keep track of changes and revert if needed;
    \item simplify the configuration (thanks to a simple configuration file with all the paths);
    \item include a wrapper that allows having multiple instances of Medslick running simultaneously;
    \item separate software from data.
\end{itemize}

The result of this re-organisation is represented by two tarballs: \texttt{medslik-src.tar.gz} and \texttt{medslik-data.tar.gz}. In each of the files there are simplified installation scripts and readme files. So, in order to install medslik:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ tar xzvf medslik-src.tar.gz
$ cd medslik-src
$ emacs medslik-src/EXE/medslik.conf
$ ./source/compile.sh
\end{lstlisting}

And then, to add its datasets:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ tar xzvf medslik-data.tar.gz
$ cd medslik-data
$ emacs medslik-data/install.conf
$ ./install.sh
\end{lstlisting}

These two repositories will be on CMCC's GitHub page soon.
